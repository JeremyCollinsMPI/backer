Our Mandarin Fruit & Vegetable Wash removes residual pesticides, oils, waxes and agricultural chemicals from fruit and vegetables, and leaves no aftertaste. Even organically grown produce is vulnerable to the effects of drift spray, human handling, mould spores, and dirt. A simple rinse may not suffice.Koala Ecoâ€™s biodegradable and eco-friendly plant-based formula cleans produce without the need for anything toxic. Taste the difference when you return your fruit and vegetables to the way nature intended.
